# Page Count

**NOTE**: This extension is still in development and does not yet work.

Ever wondered how many total webpages you've visited on any given day? Page Count is a chrome extension for to answer just that question. It displays the total number of pages you've visited for the day to help you guage your productivity, to help you decide when it's time to finally call it quits and hit the hay, or just to satisfy your curiosity.

### About the build

- Page Count was started from [Extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com/) by [@altryne](https://github.com/altryne/), a web app for generating boilerplate Chrome extensions based on the setup options you choose.
- This extension is a [Browser Action](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction.html) extension.
